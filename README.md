Last week I was able to complete the entire project in 3-4 days and was able to have some time off for once.
This week, a game I was looking forward to released and I've been busy juggling that and side projects.
Now I have 3 days to get this project done. Let's see if I can do it again. In fact, I'm goning to aim to
get it done in 2 days so i have some time off yet again.

With all the side projects I'm juggling at once, I feel like I need to freeze
time for a whole 6-12 months just to work on side projects.
